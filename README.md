# Pokemon DexChallenge

DexChallenge is a Pokemon challenge game where you have to enter all of the Pokemon from the PokeDex (currently just the Kanto PokeDex). It tracks your progress by showing you the Pokemon you have entered (and how many) and also showing you how many remain.

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br>
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br>
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br>
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br>

### `npm run deploy`

Deploys the app to GitHub pages. This invokes build first.
